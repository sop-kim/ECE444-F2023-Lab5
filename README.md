**Pros of TDD**

Using TDD can bring all developers on the same page before actually developing the code. This is because creating tests beforehand makes the expected functionality very concrete, and it is easy to tell what we are aiming for. Another advantage is that testing is not rushed, because you create the tests before you write code and have to ensure that the tests pass before the code is even merged. This leads to a higher degree of confidence when the app is deployed.

**Cons of TDD**

While TDD is being widely adopted as a good practice, it does have drawbacks. For one, it doesnâ€™t always result in better code. Tests that are written poorly or incorrectly may cause unnecessary or incorrect code in return. This puts pressure on developers to write thorough tests that consider all possibilities. This means that TDD can take more time, as developers spend a significant portion of their time and effort writing and using tests carefully.
